Any such arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitrator experienced in the “Sharing Economy,” and shall include a written record of the arbitration hearing. The parties reserve the right to object to any individual who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization or entity. An award of arbitration may be confirmed in a court of competent jurisdiction. The parties shall endeavor to settle any such dispute via good faith negotiation prior to initiating any arbitration proceeding.
